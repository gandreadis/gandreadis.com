## Short Biography

Ir. Georgios Andreadis is a PhD candidate at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and guest researcher in the Life Sciences and Health (LSH) research group at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), under supervision of dr. Tanja Alderliesten and prof.dr. Peter A.N. Bosman. Andreadis obtained his BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science at Delft University of Technology in 2020. For his MSc thesis research on cloud capacity planning, he was awarded the title of Best Graduate of the TU Delft. The focus of his current PhD research is on multi-objective deformable image registration for medical images, using evolutionary algorithms. The large anatomical differences frequently present between medical scans of patients make transferring knowledge between scans an open challenge. In his research, he aims to find a method for deformable image registration that is flexible and reliable enough for clinical application but also involves the expertise of clinical users into the process.
